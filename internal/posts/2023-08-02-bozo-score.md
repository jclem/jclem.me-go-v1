Upon hearing that I recently hit the five-year milestone in my job at GitHub, a
friend recently remarked, "He did it!" This post isn't about how I did it; it's
not about my job at GitHub at all. It's about Bozo. Bozo the Clown.

And ChatGPT.

Growing up, I watched Bozo a lot. Specifically, _The Bozo Super Sunday Show_
(whose title I hadn't remembered yet, in this story). One thing I remembered
from the show was a frequently-played game in which the kids on the show were
challenged with tossing ping-pong balls into buckets at a distance. When they
hit the target, I have always distinctly remembered Bozo exclaiming, "He did
it!" or "She did it!" For some reason, as a kid I always found it really
motivating to hear—and I'll admit that as an adult, I'll say it to myself when I
accomplish something I found challenging or daunting at first.

Curious about what happened to my old friend Bozo, I began searching around and
came across a Wikipedia article, which shook me to my core: the Wikipedia [list
of local TV Bozos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_the_Clown#Local_TV_Bozos).
Until this moment, I had always assumed that _my_ Bozo was _everyone's_ Bozo.
This brings to mind an extremely unscientific philosophical conversation I had
with a friend in junior high school, where we wondered aloud how we knew for
sure that what _I_ perceived as the color blue was the same as what _he_
perceived as the color blue (I am fairly certain many folks have a conversation
like this at some point). Finding this Wikipedia article was like Nature Herself
materialized (perhaps in a white ruffle, red nose, and oversized shoes) and
cracked open that junior high school epistemological quandary and laid bare an
uncomfortable truth about being and perception: _My Bozo_ may not have been
_your Bozo_.

My immediate thought upon learning that the Bozo I knew and loved was but one of
many—at the same time and throughout time—was that I needed to find out which
Bozo was my Bozo. Which Bozo was my Bozo? Was the cat alive or dead? Was my Bozo
an up Bozo or a down Bozo? Chicago Bozo or Brazil Bozo?

Naturally, I pasted the LoLTB[^1] into ChatGPT's new code interptreter interface
and asked it to find out for me. Unfortunately, the first response was deeploy
disappointing. I included in my request that I was a child in Dayton, Ohio, in
the late 1980s and early 1990s, but ChatGPT instead focused _only_ my location,
suggesting immediately that my Bozo was one named Dave Eaton, who performed in
Dayton and Springfield, Ohio in the late 1960s through the early 1970s. I knew
my Bozo wasn't _vintage Bozo_ at the time of airing, so this couldn't have been
it. So, I told ChatGPT that no, my Bozo was performing on television in the late
1980s and early 1990s. I figured it would immediately start doing some analysis
of the list I had pasted with some Python code, but instead, ChatGPT just told
me that there was no Bozo the Clown performer in Dayton, Ohio, at this time.
While this is true, I was disappointed that the model wouldn't instead begin
looking for the _nearest_ Bozo, instead, which is what I wanted:
